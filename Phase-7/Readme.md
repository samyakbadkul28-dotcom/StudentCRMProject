# Phase-7: Data Management  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
In this phase, we managed data in Salesforce by:  
- Preparing objects with External ID fields  
- Importing Programs, Student Inquiries, Applications, and Enrollments  
- Handling import errors  
- Setting up duplicate management (Matching Rule + Duplicate Rule)  
- Backing up data with Data Export  
- Creating Data Quality reports  

This ensures data integrity, proper parent-child relationships, and error-free imports.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 0 â€” Prepare Objects  
- Checked **Record Name** type (Text vs Auto Number).  
- Created External ID fields:  
  - Program Code (`Program_Code__c`)  
  - Inquiry External Id (`Inquiry_External_Id__c`)  
  - Application External Id (`Application_External_Id__c`)  
  - Enrollment External Id (`Enrollment_External_Id__c`)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€” Import Programs  
- Imported `Programs.csv` using **Data Import Wizard**.  
- Mapped fields: Program Code, Department, Duration, Fees.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€” Import Student Inquiries

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5 â€” Handle Import Errors  
- Downloaded Error File when imports failed.  
- Fixed issues like missing External IDs or wrong date formats.  
- Re-ran import with corrected CSV.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6 â€” Duplicate Management  
### Matching Rule (by Email)  
- Created Matching Rule: Email must be unique.

### Duplicate Rule  
- Created Duplicate Rule to block/alert duplicates during Inquiry creation.
