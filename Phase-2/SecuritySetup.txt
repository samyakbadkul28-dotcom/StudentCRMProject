# Phase-2: Security Setup

- Profiles control what actions a user can perform (e.g., Admission Counselor Profile can create and edit Student Inquiries).
- Roles define who can see records in the role hierarchy (e.g., Admissions Manager can see all Admission Counselor records).
- Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) set the baseline visibility of records.
- Sharing Rules will later allow access to other counselors/managers when needed.
- Permission Sets provide extra access without changing profiles (Admissions Manager PS created).
