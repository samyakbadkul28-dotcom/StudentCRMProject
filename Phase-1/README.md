# Phase 1 – Requirements Gathering

This folder contains all deliverables for Phase 1 of the Student Enrollment & Engagement CRM project.

## Problem Statement
Colleges receive student inquiries from web, events, walk-ins, and social media. Follow-up is slow and tracking is manual, which causes lost opportunities.  
We will use Salesforce CRM to automate the entire flow: **Inquiry → Application → Enrollment**.

## Stakeholders
- **Admin** – manages Salesforce org.
- **Admission Counselor** – communicates with students.
- **Manager** – monitors performance via dashboards.
- **Student** – applies to programs.

## Goals
1. Capture every student inquiry in Salesforce.
2. Assign each inquiry to a counselor automatically.
3. Track progress from Application → Admission → Enrollment.
4. Send email/SMS updates to students.
5. Give managers dashboards and reports.
